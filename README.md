I know there are bunch of prayer time apps out there. But what unique about this app as it is a PWA, meaning you can install it in any device running any chromium-based browser, WITHOUT DOWNLOADING ANY EXECUTABLE FILE!
Also it works without any internet!

# Warning
This project is not completed yet. But usable in most cases, I guess!
