## Live at [here](https://ms-jahan.github.io/Prayer-Times-PWA/)

I know there are bunch of prayer time apps out there. But what is unique about this app as it is a PWA, meaning you can install it on any device running any Chromium-based browser, WITHOUT DOWNLOADING ANY EXECUTABLE FILE!
Also, it works without any internet!

# Warning
This project is not completed yet. But usable in most cases, I guess!
